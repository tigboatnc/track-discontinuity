# Train Defect Detector 

OpenCV based video processing pipeline for finding discontinuities on train tracks. 
- Ideal for using on drone footage. 
- Leverages mathematical models of train tracks to detect discontinuities.  
- Built as a large scale automated discontinuity identification for Indian train tracks <br>
